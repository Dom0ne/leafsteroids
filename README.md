# Leafsteroids

This repository contains the MongoDB `Leafsteroids` demo.  
Follow the instructions in this README to run a clone of your own to get your MongoDB development jump started.

## Architecture

The demo and repository consist of the following parts:

- Game Client (Unity3D, .NET, C#)
- Game Server (Python, flask)
- Website (Blazor Server Application, .NET)

## Running your own clone

### Requirements

- Install Python and PIP
- Install the .NET SDK 7

### Prepare the database (MongoDB Atlas)

- Create a new [Atlas project](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
- Create a new cluster (M0)
- Create a new database `Leafsteroids`:
    - Create a collection `config` and add the [`deployment/templates/config.template`](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/leafsteroids/blob/main/deployment/templates/config.template) document to it.
    - Create a collection `events` and add the [`deployment/templates/event.template`](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/leafsteroids/blob/main/deployment/templates/event.template) document to it.

You can adjust the config to change how the game behaves and add more events to have several to choose from.

### Run the Game Server

- Switch into the `rest_service` folder.
- Make a copy of the `.env.template` file and call it `.env`.
- Grab the connection string for your Atlas cluster and exchange it in the `.env` file in the `rest_service` folder.

```shell
dotnet run
```

### Run the Website

- Switch into the `website` folder.
- Make a copy of the `.env.template` file and call it `.env`.
- Grab the connection string for your Atlas cluster and exchange it in the `.env` file in the `game_server` folder.

```shell
dotnet run
```

### Run the Game Client

- Switch into the `game_client` folder.
- In the `Assets` folder, make a copy of the `.env.template` file and call it `.env`.
- Adjust the IP in the `.env` folder to your `game_server`. Leave as is when running locally.
- Run the game.
