# Leafsteroids

This repository contains the MongoDB `Leafsteroids` demo.  
Follow the instructions in this README to run a clone of your own to get your MongoDB development jump started.

## Architecture

The demo and repository consist of the following parts:

- Game Client (Unity3D, .NET, C#)
- Game Server (Python, flask)
- Website (Blazor Server Application, .NET)

## Running your own clone

### Prepare the database (MongoDB Atlas)

- Create a new Atlas project
- Create a new cluster (M0)
- Create a new database `Leafsteroids`:
    - Create a collection `config` and add the `config.template` document to it.
    - Create a collection `events` and add the `event.template` document to it.

You can adjust the config to change how the game behaves and add more events to have several to choose from.

### Run the Game Server

```shell
cd game_server
cp .env.template .env
```

- Grab the connection string for your Atlas cluster and exchange it in the `.env` file.

```shell
gunicorn --log-level=debug -b 0.0.0.0:8000 application:app
```

### Run the Website

```shell
cd website
cp .env.template .env
```

- Grab the connection string for your Atlas cluster and exchange it in the `.env` file.

```shell
dotnet run
```

### Run the Game Client

- Open the Unity project.
- In the `Assets` folder, duplicate the `.env.template` file and call it `.env`.
- Since the game server is running in locally when going through above steps, you can keep the defaults.
- Run the game.
