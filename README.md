# Leafsteroids

This repository contains the MongoDB `Leafsteroids` demo.  
Follow the instructions in this README to run a clone of your own to get your MongoDB development jump started.

## Architecture

The demo and repository consist of the following parts:

- Game Client (Unity3D, .NET, C#)
- Game Server (ASP.NET Web API, .NET, C#)
- Website (Blazor Server Application, .NET, C#)

## Running your own clone

### Requirements

- [Install the .NET SDK 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)

### Prepare the database (MongoDB Atlas)

- [Create a new Atlas project](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
- [Create a new cluster (M0)](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/)
- [Create a new database](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database) `Leafsteroids`:
    - Create a collection `config` and add
      the [`deployment/templates/config.template`](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/leafsteroids/blob/main/deployment/templates/config.template)
      document to it.
    - Create a collection `events` and add
      the [`deployment/templates/event.template`](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/leafsteroids/blob/main/deployment/templates/event.template)
      document to it.

You can adjust the config to change how the game behaves and add more events to have several to choose from.  
To get started, it is recommended to use those default documents.

### Run the REST service

- Switch into the `rest_service` folder.
- Make a copy of the `.env.template` file and call it `.env`.
- [Grab the connection string for your Atlas cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/connection-string/) and
  exchange it in the `.env` file in the `rest_service` folder.
- Also replace the `DATABASE_NAME` in the `.env` file with the database name you created earlier.

```shell
dotnet run --urls "http://0.0.0.0:8000"
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to verify the REST service is running.

### Run the Website

- Switch into the `website` folder.
- Make a copy of the `.env.template` file and call it `.env`.
- [Grab the connection string for your Atlas cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/connection-string/) and
  exchange it in the `.env` file in the `website` folder.
- Also replace the `DATABASE_NAME` in the `.env` file with the database name you created earlier.

```shell
dotnet run --urls "http://0.0.0.0:8001"
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8001/ to verify the website is running.

### Run the Game Client

- Switch into the `game_client` folder.
- In the `Assets` folder, make a copy of the `.env.template` file and call it `.env`.
- Adjust the IP in the `.env` folder to your `rest_service`. Leave as is when running locally.
- Run the game.
